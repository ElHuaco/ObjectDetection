# PyTorch Implementation of Single Shot MultiBox Detection

This repository contains the code for building and training the [SSD model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) using PyTorch. The model is trained on the Microsoft COCO Dataset and can be used for object detection in images.

**Requirements**: <tt>PyTorch 1.13.0+cu117</tt>

## ðŸš§ðŸš§ The model is currently training and the final results will be published when available.
